This repository contains the extracted data of the AEA climate survey released on March 18, 2019, in CSV format (with commas instead of pipes, sorry Paul!)

Tables are numbered according to the AEA's report (see `report.pdf`). Please also refer to the report for the tables' notices.

To allow anyone to double check, `tabula-extraction` (`zip` and folder) both contain the raw CSV files extracted by Tabula from the PDF. I (Olivier) corrected them by hand.
